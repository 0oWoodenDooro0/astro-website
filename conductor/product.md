# Product Guide: Personal Website & Portfolio

## Vision
A comprehensive personal website serving as a professional portfolio, a technical archive, and a personal journal. It aims to bridge the gap between showcasing technical expertise to potential employers and sharing personal stories with friends and family.

## Target Audience
- **Potential Employers & Recruiters:** To view professional projects and skills.
- **Friends & Family:** To keep up with personal updates and blog posts.
- **Developers:** To reference configuration files and technical project details.

## Core Features
1.  **Configuration / Dotfiles Archive:**
    -   A dedicated section for hosting and displaying computer configuration files (config/dotfiles).
    -   Supports syntax highlighting and a "terminal-window" visual style.

2.  **Project Portfolio:**
    -   **Visual Layout:** Grid view with thumbnails and brief descriptions for easy browsing.
    -   **Integration:** Cards feature GitHub links, tech stack tags, and custom icons.
    -   **Interaction:** Clickable project cards that lead to dedicated, detailed project pages with full Markdown content.
    -   **Purpose:** To systematically organize and showcase past work in a detailed and navigable manner.

3.  **Blog & Journal:**
    -   **Content:** A mix of technical articles and personal life updates.
    -   **Format:** Full Markdown rendering with themed typography (prose).
    -   **Organization:** Categorization to separate technical logs from personal diaries.

## Strategic Goals
- **Organization:** To compile and present a curated list of past projects.
- **Archival:** To safely store and share useful configuration files.
- **Expression:** To provide a platform for recording thoughts, experiences, and technical learnings.
